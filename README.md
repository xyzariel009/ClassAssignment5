## Dataset
This data is from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and was collected via a survey on Amazon Mechanical Turk. The survey describes different driving scenarios, including the destination, current time, weather, and passenger, and then asks people whether they will accept the coupon if they are the driver. There are three possible answers people can choose from:

“Right away”
“Later, before the coupon expires”
“No, I do not want the coupon”
The first two responses are labeled as “Y = 1,” and the third is labeled as “Y = 0.” There are five different types of coupons: Less expensive restaurants (under $20), coffee houses, carryout and takeaway, bars, and more expensive restaurants ($20–$50).

## Data Analysis
* Overall coupon acceptance rate
* Acceptance rates by coupon type (coffee house and bar)
* Visualization

## Findings
### Drivers who accept bar coupons:
* Go to bars regularly (more than once a month).
* Are not traveling with kids.
* Tend to be younger (under 30) or middle-aged (25–40).
* Possibly preferring inexpensive dining.

### Drivers who accept coffee house coupons:
* Traveling with friends or a partner.
* Tend to be younger or mid-aged.
* In sunny or rainy day.
* Young people with friends or mid-aged people with partner.

## Recommendations
* Bar Coupons: Target frequent bar visitors over 25 years old who drive without kids.
* Coffee House Coupons: Target younger or social passengers (friends, partners) especially during good weather.
